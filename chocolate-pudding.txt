White chocolate and almond croissant pudding

Ingredients:
- 4 plain croissants butter 
- 150 g white chocolate - roughly chopped 
- 50 g almond flakes 
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon 
- 3 Tbs demerara sugar 
- 250 ml cream 
- 3 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C.

Cut croissants into slices 1 to 2 cm thick. 

Butter each slice on both sides.

In greased ramekins, layer croissant slices with a sprinkle of almonds, chocolate, demerara sugar and cinnamon alternately until all ingredients have been used. 

You should have about three layers of croissant in each ramekin. 

Finish with a croissant layer and sprinkle with demerara sugar.

Whisk together the cream and eggs. Pour mixture into each ramekin. 

Allow a few minutes for the mixture to be absorbed by the croissants and then top up each ramekin.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until egg and cream mixture is set.

Dust with icing sugar and top with almonds. 

Serve straight from the oven.
